## how to make a offline WebMap?
>> Simply, to make an offline WebMap, just need two things ---- map tiles and scripts.
>> Map tiles, we can get them from google or baidu as you like, but the rules used by the different company are different.
>> scripts, that's the important. Avoiding make the same whole repeatedly, i use the opensource script: [OpenLayers](https://github.com/openlayers/ol2),based on openLayer, we can show the tiles easily!

## quick start
  `grunt server`

## what else can we do on the Map?
